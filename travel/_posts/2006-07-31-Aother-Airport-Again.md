I am taking another of my trips to Helsinki for work. Today I took the later flight, and I have to say that I am happy to have flown British Airways. I find there’s something reassuring about flying with [British Airways](http://www.ba.com) (but don’t ask me what). The woman sitting in front of me was sporting a pink cowboy hat for some reason (it was remarkably similar to [these I found on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/redbettyblack/17208203/)), but I don’t think the warm and comfy feeling came from that.

Given the late hour of our arrival, I imagine the cabin crew were spending the night in Helsinki too. Only on British Airways would you see them carrying a proper pint of milk with them. I can only dream of arriving at the hotel and making myself a decent cuppa!

The flight was uneventful. Solitaire managed to send me to sleep, which was a good job as I had forgotten the headphones for my Treo and couldn’t listen to the many podcast delights I take on my travels. Note to self: buy a spare set of headphones.

And so to the hotel, where I was upgraded to a superior room. I think that means the desk on which you can place your laptop is on the other side of the room rather than right by the bed. That means, as I type this, I am straining to watch the television, which is – handily – right across the room. Still, there was an old [Starsky &amp; Hutch](http://web.archive.org/web/20020720100218/http://www.starskyandhutchonline.com/) and an episode of [Alfred Hitchcock Presents](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047708/) to entertain me as I fall asleep. Which is exactly where I am heading now.
