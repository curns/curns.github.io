[The Lyric Theatre](http://www.officiallondontheatre.co.uk/theatres/display?contentId=67261) on Shaftesbury Avenue is currently home to a production of [Festen](https://web.archive.org/web/20040923052836/http://www.whatsonstage.com/Festen/Pages/festenhomepage.htm), David Eldridge’s adaptation of the cult film by Thomas Vinterberg. The play, directed by Rufus Norris, no longer has the original cast, but I don’t think that matters: it’s a stunning piece of theatre.

[thisistheatre.com sums it up well](https://web.archive.org/web/20230128130815/https://www.thisistheatre.com/londonshows/festen.html): Patriarch Helge Klingenfelt is celebrating his 60th birthday with his family at a magnificent old hotel in the Danish countryside. Gathered together are his loyal wife Elsa, his daughter Helene, and sons Christian and Michael. As the evening progresses, Christian feels compelled to break the silence surrounding a dark family secret. The effect is explosive and sets the tone for a celebration no one will forget! // [Source](https://web.archive.org/web/20230128130815/https://www.thisistheatre.com/londonshows/festen.html)

I don’t want to give the plot away any more, but you can read a little more at The Independent’s review (and some non-plot-spoiling reviewer’s comments at the [Festen site](https://web.archive.org/web/20040925005412/http://www.whatsonstage.com/Festen/Pages/SynopsisPage.htm)). Regardless, it’s a powerful piece of work with some excellent acting. It’s hard to pick anybody out, but [Stephen Moore](http://www.whatsonstage.com/Festen/Pages/Cast_StephenMoore.htm) (Helge), [Paul Nicholls](https://web.archive.org/web/20050204184659/http://www.paulnichollsonline.co.uk/) (Christian) and [Lisa Palfrey](https://web.archive.org/web/20051204002401/http://www.whatsonstage.com/Festen/Pages/Cast_ClaireRushbrook.htm) (Helene) are just three of the wonderful performances.

Credit must also be given to designer Ian MacNeil and all the others involved in staging this work. It’s a simple yet stunningly effective set that is a wonder. The stark, dark stage that opens the play hides some very clever set work.

As it appears only to be running until the start of May, I would advise you to go now! [thisistheatre.com has tickets](https://web.archive.org/web/20230128130815/https://www.thisistheatre.com/londonshows/festen.html).
