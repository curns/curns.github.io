title: "The Original App Store Was Your TV (or Radio)"

Regular readers (ha!) will know that I tend to keep track (or a copy) of significant postings I make [elsewhere][Link to a page]({ site.baseurl }{% /elsewhere.md %}) on this site so that I have a consolidated view of my various ramblings. Don’t ask me why.

Earlier today, my friend Austin sent me a link to the video embedded here. My [original response](https://www.facebook.com/joncurnow/posts/10153517624446989) was on Facebook, but I’m saving it here because the video makes me smile.

> Austin Scott shared this video today. It brought back so many memories. It’s funny to think that we downloaded programmes from the television & radio in the way that’s shown towards the end of this video. “Stand by for the software transmission” (at 5 mins 30) is very funny but it’s really how we used to do it. Who could have foreseen the app stores? I remember recording programmes from the radio which was much easier. Who had a TV that connected to a cassette recorder?
> 
> 10 years after this TV programme aired, somebody asked me “why do we need email when we have the fax”? Naming no names here to protect the guilty.

Seeing the old BBC Micro really reminds me of my final years at school. My [O-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCE_Ordinary_Level) computer project was to design a piece of software and I developed a contact & mailing management system. It was too great a task to undertake in BBC Basic. I finished it but only managed to submit the coursework thanks to my parents spending an evening printing the code (yes, we had to do that) and helping me file it properly. Today, I guess we’d call it CRM. If only I’d kept at it. Perhaps it could have been [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/).
