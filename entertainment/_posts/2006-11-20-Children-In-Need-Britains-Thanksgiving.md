[Children In Need](http://www.bbc.co.uk/pudsey/) is Britain’s version of Thanksgiving. It comes around every November and it changes the television schedules (not always for the better). And that’s about where the similarities end, but they say you start a piece of writing with a punchy statement to hook your audience. So, there you go. Thank me later.

I am fairly sure that the good folks in America have their very own Terry Wogan (the American version may also be a genial Irishman, given the number of people from the Emerald Isle who shipped across the water), but I have no idea and can’t pretend I care, for there really is nobody to rival Sir Terry (he is a Sir, [Wikipedia told me so](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Wogan) and – therefore – it must be true).

Children In Need, of course, was last Friday night. You might have tuned in for Jonathan Ross but you got Kim and Aggie trying to clean a Status Quo dressing room. I imagine you’re over the trauma now. It’s Monday and I am wittering on about it purely because *The Guardian* – free on Finnair flights from London Heathrow – has an item on [a week in the life of a Pudsey](http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1952243,00.html) (well, the bloke in the costume, Leeds version). As one of Wogan’s listeners would no doubt email his show, ‘what is the world coming to when Pudsey is attacked by scallies in Bradford’? Seriously, I’m turning all *Daily Mail* indignant about it.

It’s this sudden surge of middle-Englandness that has prompted me to pick up the *Listen To Musak* quill once more. For it’s not only hoodies attacking Pudsey that got me all stirred up while reading the paper but the very notion that Dame Shirley Bassey is singing about a night on ecstasy in the current Christmas Marks and Spencer television commercial. I imagine, if I were a legal type, I should add that Dame Shirls probably didn’t know what Pink’s ‘Get The Party Started’ was all about. And why should she? If truth be known, nor did I until I read it in, guess, [today’s Guardian](http://music.guardian.co.uk/pop/comment/story/0,,1952290,00.html) (really, there was nothing else to do on the plane).

Should you ever admit to liking a television commercial? I am not sure that you should, but I do like the M&S ad. If you don’t know Marks and Spencer – and their place in British life – then you probably won’t get it and you could skip to the last paragraph. But it’s smart, plays nicely on the current James Bond mania and, let’s face it, must have cost a fortune (which I think is a good thing in TV advertising).

In fact, I love it so much I YouTubed it (isn’t that what all the kids are doing these days?) [Go view it.](https://youtu.be/JBT88STzSXE) But then I found a rendition of [Goldfinger](https://youtu.be/EnseiOJ2jGQ) by the very same Dame Shirley Bassey which is also fantastic (and is, if you believe Saturday night’s Channel Four countdown show, the most popular Bond theme of all time). Then I found Sheena Easton’s [For Your Eyes Only](https://youtu.be/JP4xXjW97ko). You know that one. Sheena was a nice girl-next-door type who sang about being a Modern Girl but then went glam singing the Bond title sequence and gazing into your eyes as you gazed at her in the cinemas of 1981. Oh, YouTube has [Modern Girl too](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zj7zkj1IzHo).

So, before I get hooked, I’d better go.
