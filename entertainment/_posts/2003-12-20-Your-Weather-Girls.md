I have been recovering from my trip to the USA by spending a great deal of today asleep and generally catching up on the mail, the Christmas cards, the washing and all the other things you need to do when you’ve been away for a week. It’s almost Saturday night, and I am going supermarket shopping (you see, dear reader, I have a very exciting life).  

While I managed to listen to the radio and some CDs, I did, eventually, resort to music television so that there were some pictures to provide an alternative visual while I drank my tea (real tea, not a USA-style tea, is one of the greatest comforters in my life).  

[The Hits](https://web.archive.org/web/20031204011016/http://www.freeview.co.uk/whatson/ch18.html "digital tv channel The Hits is on Freeview and Sky Digital") is showing some so-called classics this afternoon. The video for [It’s Raining Men (The Weather Girls)](http://members.tripod.com/discolyrics/lyrics/twg_irm.htm "It's Raining Men! Hallelujah! - It's Raining Men! Amen!") looked so dated that it made me wonder what those brought up entirely on the sophistication of the modern-day music video would make of these dated images.  

Interestingly, it occurred to me that it’s the video that looks a lot older than the music sounds. Allowing for the fact that *It’s Raining Men* is part of the soundtrack to my youth, I still think it’s the video technology that has made the most noticeable leaps in the last 20 years.  

And it’s 20 years next March since *It’s Raining Men* was a hit for [The Weather Girls](https://web.archive.org/web/20040819065658/http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/weather_girls/bio.jhtml "Izora Rhodes and Martha Wash met in the San Francisco-based gospel group, NOW (News Of The World) prior to joining the backing group of rising disco star Sylvester."). Originally charting in the UK in August 1983, it eventually made number 2 in March 1984. It’s one of those songs that I would have sworn topped the charts but, apparently, not. I would imagine that a combination of Nena’s *[99 Red Balloons](https://web.archive.org/web/20040926084933/http://www.80smusiclyrics.com/artists/nena.htm "You and I in a little toy shop, Buy a bag of balloons with the money we've got")*, Lionel Richie’s *[Hello](https://web.archive.org/web/20040902083350/http://www.80smusiclyrics.com/artists/lionelrichie.htm "I've been alone with you inside my mind")*, and Duran Duran’s *[The Reflex](https://web.archive.org/web/20030924221210/http://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/duran_duran/seven_and_the_ragged_tiger/the_reflex/ "You've gone too far this time but I'm dancing on the valentine")* kept it from the number 1 slot.
