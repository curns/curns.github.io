[On Monday]({% post_url /entertainment/2006-11-20-Children-In-Need-Britains-Thanksgiving %}) I blew some of the cobwebs off the site and actually posted something of length that wasn’t a link to another site. I blamed the urge to write on reading *The Guardian* on my flight to Finland and that might be relevant, but I suspect it’s also something to do with the current state of the blogs I read.

At various times on this site I have tried to avoid the term ‘blog’. I don’t really like it. Some people don’t like the word ‘moist’. It makes them feel a bit, well, icky (is that a word?). The term ‘blog’ does the same for me, but I shall have to seek therapy because these days everybody from the aforementioned [Guardian](https://web.archive.org/web/20061205031256/http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/index.html) to the [BBC](https://web.archive.org/web/20061007132554/http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/) via [The Telegraph](https://web.archive.org/web/20061007132554/http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/) and [The Economist](http://neweconomist.blogs.com/) seems to have a blog of some description. I am now embracing the word from this point on. Bloggety blog blog (see, cured).

Anyway, at last count (about 5 seconds ago) [Bloglines](https://web.archive.org/web/20060311013054/http://www.bloglines.com/public/musak) had a feed of 124 subscriptions for my account (not all of them public). Take off the 15 I read for work (well, I subscribe then delete all the items when they get to about 100) and that’s still well over 100 things I am ‘watching’. But only a few of them are things I read. [I listed some of them in 2002](https://web.archive.org/web/20030302030210/http://www.musak.org/entries/2002/11/give_us_our_daily_blog.shtml), although that list is dated with a good number of dead links. But few people are writing any more and those that are penning words are doing so at such a rate that I have a scary back catalogue of entries to read: Steve, that includes you. So, either I have too much to read that I’m scared to wade in, or I have reams of other people’s links that I don’t want to follow.

Anyway, in need of something better, I decided that I should start writing once again. [I once said that I only did this for my own amusement](dayone://view?entryId=1FAFEE5F064447C6A431964780E0E1A3) (and when I used to look at *Listen To Musak*’s logs I would have said that was very true), so I’ve decided to add a few more entries and see how we go but, and I bet I’ve said this before but I can’t be bothered to check, this time it will be different.

When I started this (for my own amusement, remember) I enjoyed the act of sitting down and writing. Truthfully, I am not sure I ever wrote a word that was very interesting to others (although [Happy Birthday in Russian](dayone://view?entryId=E27C04C724C94F92822BC5E7B3AF5782) seems to keep bringing people to the site – [twice](dayone://view?entryId=3039D28709CF40C4A3E0DB652221B4C0)) but it’s a record of my life that isn’t captured anywhere else. There’s a reason the ‘on this day’ links are at the end of every entry. I click. I find it interesting to place myself back a few years. [Last Monday’s](dayone://view?entryId=123DD5B5667547888FA18557F9320AEA) entry had four back years for that day and I was fascinated to see that I made references to [Blur](dayone://view?entryId=35300E12E3054730BDC786CB268BCCD5), [traffic congestion](dayone://view?entryId=521195C5465748A5BCD766B869909E30), [spam](dayone://view?entryId=64D184DF36D5496DB4B6BAA30EF644A0) and [Big Brother](dayone://view?entryId=EED7DD5C89414CF590BB364D057A5AB3) in the preceding years; I guess they are still topics of conversation now. And you don’t really get that sense of personal history from a list of links to other things (which become dead links by the time you’re nostalgic enough to check them).

After a while, however, a blog becomes like a pair of concrete shoes. It weighs you down and you begin to sink. I don’t blog about work, family or my boyfriend (hey, [Dave, you’re not the only one](https://web.archive.org/web/20061129045826/http://www.soliloqueer.com/2006/11/on_being_a_blogging_dumbass.php)) and sometimes I ask what I am doing it for? I wonder if you can get treatment for some kind of non-blogging depression? That’s what happened here. I wanted to post daily. I wanted to build that sense of personal history. But I couldn’t. It was too much, so it faded.

And now I’m starting again. Less concerned about tracking life and probably with not much more to say but with a heightened sense of why I am doing it.

I wanted to end with a triumphant ‘read on’ but you can’t do that until I write the next piece. And who knows when that will be?
