There are many reasons why I am happy to have a web presence. Some of them are simple and to do with how I first came across the internet. You can read about that, and my opinions on browser standards, in [colophon]({% post_url /everyday/2000-10-08-Colophon %}).

However, I do believe in some of the underlying principles on which the Internet, as we know it, was founded. The ideals of a less censored form of communication, open and available to all, appeal to some deep belief I have in the basics of human community. A medium that is not owned or controlled by any one individual seems to make sense to me.

I believe in the power of connected networks to allow better communication and empower people who would not otherwise have a voice. The world is better for open and free expression of opinions and thoughts even if, sometimes, we disagree with those opinions or find them, somehow, unpleasant. I would rather thoughts and feelings were on the web than contained within and ready to erupt into violence ([when thoughts turn to violence we all lose](http://web.archive.org/web/20040929095553/http://www.geocities.com/corkymcg/crime/proj005.html)).

While I am in the spirit of the net, don’t forget to check out [The Open Directory Project](http://web.archive.org/web/20000706201149/http://www.dmoz.org//) and play your part in creating the greatest web directory of them all!

Of course, this all sounds very grand but many years ago I just wanted to play with HTML and see what I could do. I’ve moved on a lot from those early experiments with the Mosaic Browser (yes, [Netscape](http://web.archive.org/web/20000621035407/http://home.netscape.com/index1.html) and Internet Explorer were some way off) but wish I’d held onto some of those early efforts. Where is the archive of the way the web looked in 1993? I wish I had the screenshots!

Digital networks may have changed our lives, but I do not think they should take over our lives, and that’s probably why there isn’t much here yet! Still, if you have anything to say, or more especially if you are a Curnow, [why not drop me a note?](https://www.curnow.org/contact-jon/)
