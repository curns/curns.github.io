In common with any page of links, many of the pages noted below have long since moved, closed or ceased to be updated in any regular kind of way. Facebook and Twitter have meant some of those who I used to read have moved on to the next way to communicate their thoughts. I keep this here as a nice reminder of the early days of blogging! I've tried to link to archived versions of many of the sites.

As I started redeveloping this site, it became apparent that I wanted to link to my collection of daily blog reads and this became the place to keep them.

The first, almost daily, read is [Jase Wells](http://www.jasewells.com/). I guess I have been something of an invisible online stalker to this site for years. I have watched it move, change and develop since sometime in 1994 when I first came across it. It still remains one of the best personal homepages on the web – and I am very pleased to see that he has turned it into a blog.

Next on the list is [Tom Coates’ plasticbag.org](http://www.plasticbag.org/) – which must be one of the best around and, if I am honest, I miss it if he doesn’t post. You will find [notsosoft](http://web.archive.org/web/20021112210724/http://www.notsosoft.com/blog/) linked from there which, I think, contains some of the best writing on the web.

[trabaca](http://web.archive.org/web/20021126001706/http://www.trabaca.com/), [posterboy](http://web.archive.org/web/20020929225107/http://www.posterboy.org/), [eric](http://web.archive.org/web/20021016154941/http://eric.everydaylies.com/) and [contrasts.net](http://web.archive.org/web/20021016082336/http://contrasts.net/) provide additional regular reading from the US, while [Adam’s photoblog](http://web.archive.org/web/20021122022024/http://adam.gessaman.com/) provides stunning pictures on a regular basis. [overyourhead](http://web.archive.org/web/20021126152034/http://www.overyourhead.co.uk/) is a UK take, while [prolific](http://web.archive.org/web/20021113002446/http://www.prolific.org/) is based in Amsterdam. [Haddock blogs](http://www.haddock.org/blogs/) is a collection of well-known UK internet names.

Of course, the blogosphere is represented well by [Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com/) which I try and check out most days.

Others of note include [Nick Denton](http://web.archive.org/web/20021120053143/http://nickdenton.org/) and [Brendan O’Neill](http://web.archive.org/web/20021113154534/http://www.brendanoneill.net/) for opinions; [Scott Andrew](http://web.archive.org/web/20021014202132/http://www.scottandrew.com/weblog/), [Ben Hammersley](http://www.benhammersley.com/) and [Jason Kottke](http://www.kottke.org/) for web-related stuff and [Stuart Towns](http://www.sgtowns.com/) for his travelogue.

Finally, if you’re not interested in reading the ramblings of people you may never have heard of, then click along to [Will Wheaton’s blog](http://www.wilwheaton.net/index.php) which is a fascinating take on the world of celebrity.
